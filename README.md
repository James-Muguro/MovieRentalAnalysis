# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-Project
Project 2 for Udacity's Nanodegree created on September 10 2023.

## Description
In this project, we will use Python to delve into the world of data and examine the bike-sharing programs in three significant American cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Our goal is to create some code that will enable us to import and analyze this data in order to find interesting patterns by doing some number crunching. In addition, we will create a useful script that enables us to interact with this data directly in the terminal, enhancing the overall educational and engaging experience.

## Files used
* bikeshare.py - final project
* chicago.zip - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
* new_york_city.zip - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)
* washington.zip - dataset used for analysis (zipped csv file)

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your computer. Additionally, you can install the required libraries by running  `pip install pandas and numpy`

## Usage

To analyze bikeshare data, run the `bikeshare.py` script in your terminal. You can specify the city, month, and day for analysis.

python bikeshare.py: This command will launch the interactive mode, allowing you to input your preferences for data analysis.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the script, here are some common problems and their solutions:

- **Error: Invalid month input**: Ensure you enter a valid month (e.g., "January" or "all") in proper capitalization.
- **Error: Dataset not found**: Make sure you have downloaded the required dataset files (e.g., `chicago.zip`, `new_york_city.zip`, `washington.zip`) and placed them in the appropriate directory.

## Credits
I discovered a useful tool by Ahmed Samy Mekkawy to address the lack of gender and user data in Washington.

An enormous shout-out and appreciation go out to Udacity's outstanding instructors for giving such helpful information during this journey.
