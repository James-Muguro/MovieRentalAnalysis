# Movie Rentals Database Analysis
This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of a movie rental database using SQL. The project aims to answer various questions and derive insights from the database. Below is an overview of the key aspects of this analysis

## Introduction
The movie rental database used for this analysis contains information about movie rentals, including details about customers, movies, rentals, and more. SQL queries are employed to extract meaningful information from this dataset.

## Key Questions Explored
The analysis focuses on answering several key questions:
1. What is the count of rentals for each movie, categorized by film genre?
2. What does the distribution of films reveal according to each category's rental duration?
3. How do monthly rental order counts compare between the two stores?
4. Who were the top 10 paying customers and their 2007 monthly payments?

## Files and Data
The dataset for this analysis is available at [PostgreSQL Sample Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/load-postgresql-sample-database/), comprising tables related to movies, customers, rentals, and more.

## SQL Queries
SQL queries corresponding to the key questions are provided in the repository to reproduce the analysis.
